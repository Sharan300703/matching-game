# Matching Game

Matching Game is a fun memory matching game built with React. The objective is to flip over pairs of cards and match them with as few turns and as little time as possible. Once all pairs are matched, a win screen is shown; if you run out of turns (or time, if you add that feature), a lose screen appears. This project builds upon a tutorial from the Net Ninja React Course, with added features such as a timer, a scoring system, and both win and lose screens.

## Overview

Matching Game challenges your memory by requiring you to remember card positions. The game features a timer that starts on your first card click, tracks your turns, and calculates a score based on your performance. When the game concludes, a win screen displays your final score if you've matched all pairs, or a lose screen if you don't meet the game conditions.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Click to flip cards and find matching pairs.
- **Timer:** Begins on the first card click and tracks the duration of play.
- **Scoring System:** Your score is calculated based on the number of turns taken and the time elapsed.
- **Win and Lose Screens:** Depending on your performance, the game will display a win screen (when all pairs are matched) or a lose screen.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Easy Customization:** Modify the game with your own images, themes, or additional features.
